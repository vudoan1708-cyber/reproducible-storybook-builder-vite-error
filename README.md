# Current Issue(s) with the [Storybook-Builder-Vite library](https://github.com/eirslett/storybook-builder-vite/tree/main/packages/storybook-builder-vite)
1. Cannot hot reload stories file<br />
2. Either the [fetch-mock library](https://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/) doesn't work properly with storybook running on vite, or the storybook's decorator function does not work correctly. <i>Please have a look at error reproduction in the Button component's story: <b>Make API Call using Fetch-mock</b></i>
